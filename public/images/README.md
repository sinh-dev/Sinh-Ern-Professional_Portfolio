# Profile Images

Place your profile image here with the name `profile.jpg`

## Recommended specifications:
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Dimensions:** 400x500px or similar 4:5 aspect ratio
- **Quality:** High resolution (at least 800x1000px for retina displays)
- **Style:** Professional headshot or portrait
- **Background:** Neutral or can be removed (the design will add overlays)

## Alternative:
If you prefer a different filename, update the `profileImage` ref in `components/TheHero.vue`:

```javascript
const profileImage = ref('/images/your-image-name.jpg')
```
